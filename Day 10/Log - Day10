Day 10 - Log

A third of the way there!

  I have to admit that the next six days are ready
to be pushed to github because this has been so fun :).
This also gives me a safety net if I'm sick or something
happens for a few days.

  In the coarse of ten days I've gone from feeling totally
lost with the technology to feeling quite comfortable. 
Exercism.io has given me a good platform to practice with
the language. Dave Thomas' book, `Programming Elixir 1.3`
has also given me a good foundation to work from as I grow.
I've made it to page 71 in the book and have found that 
recursion with lists is a now a favorite tool of mine. 

I've really enjoyed the journey so far. See you at Day 20.
